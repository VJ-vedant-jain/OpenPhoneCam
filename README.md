# OpenPhoneCam

FOSS program that turns your phone into a high quality webcam for your computer!

# Disclaimer

This is a work-in-progress app that is right now using scrcpy to fetch the video from your android device but eventually we will move over to a native android app and companion server.

This project started out because I was fed up with those phone webcam apps relying on OBS and needing payment and limiting the resolution and other problems i just didnt like. im all for supporting developers and huge respect to those devs for doing this, but i mean if i have the ability to just... do it myself and learn many libraries and android app development simultaneously then might as well...

This project is NOT COMPLETE. Attempting to run it will give you...nothing.


# Requirements

After a functional release, we will update this part.

# Notes for future

What’s Done:

main_tab has majority of its options linked. the few left are the ones which would require a bit of "thinking"

Currently Pending:

better logging and error handling
about and settings tab ui
few options in main and cammy tab currently do not have functionality and needs to be done.

Discovered about toml files which we can use to setup the dependencies and all. Need to check it out and replace the current dependencies.txtw
